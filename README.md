# Make your image better with this git
With the help of this git you are able to train your own custom dataset on EDSR or SR-Gans
These two algorithms are used for super resolution. which will convert your (150 * 150) px image to (600 * 600) image. In case you are not able to understand things email me or comment below. I will fix that issue out. Thank you


# Dataset

1. Download the dataset from Gdrive

        https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zKEvX3ubm19kHdWFQEpD6T-0NlCE6opp?usp=sharing



2. Training of Edsr

        This notebook help you in training edsr on your custom dataset like I used brain mris. I got images with 600 by 600 diminsion, Firstly I downsize them by 2x factor (300,300) now I got my low resoltion images as well as high resolution images, than I just feed them edsr model to make an image with diminsion (300,300) to (600, 600)

# SR-Gans

**Super Resolution GAN (SRGAN)**

SRGAN was proposed by researchers at Twitter. The motive of this architecture is to recover finer textures from the image when we upscale it so that itâ€™s quality cannot be compromised. There are other methods such as Bilinear Interpolation that can be used to perform this task but they suffer from image information loss and smoothing. In this paper, the authors proposed two architectures the one without GAN (SRResNet) and one with GAN (SRGAN). It is concluded that SRGAN has better accuracy and generate image more pleasing to eyes as compared to SRGAN.

Architecture: Similar to GAN architectures, the Super Resolution GAN also contains two parts Generator and Discriminator where generator produces some data based on the probability distribution and discriminator tries to guess weather data coming from input dataset or generator.  Generator than tries to optimize the genrated data so that it can fool the discriminator. Below are the generator and discriminator architectural details:

## Loss Function SSRGANS:

The SRGAN uses perpectual loss function (LSR)  which is the weighted sum of two loss components : content loss and adversarial loss. This loss is very important for the performance of the generator architecture:

Content Loss: We use two types of content loss in this paper : pixelwise MSE loss for the SRResnet architecture, which is most common MSE loss for image Super Resolution. However MSE loss does not able to deal with high frequency content in the image that resulted in producing overly smooth images. Therefore the authors of the paper decided to  use loss of different VGG layers. This VGG loss is based on the ReLU activation layers of the pre-trained 19 layer VGG network. This loss is defined as follows

**Adversarial Loss:** The Adversarial loss is the loss function that forces the generator to image more similar to high resolution image by using a discriminator that is trained to differentiate between high resolution and super resolution images.

# Conclusions
As from the numbers of validation losses computed while training. Edsr is performing better than SRGans. 


# Hardware and software compatibility.

# Things to do

1. Will merge more models 
2. Fuse multiple model weights into one
